Program Functionality:
The program is a server based program which is concurrent. This concurrency is achieved by creating new thread for new client connection(TCP) and for new request(UDP).
select function is used for sleecting different protocol viz. TCP and UDP.

The server is multithreaded and several critical variables are locked so that multiple threads cannot access it at same time.

Based on client's reuest or command, the server acts accordingly.

Compilation steps:
1. Open Terminal

2. Change the directory to a particular location where make file is saved.

3. Type make and then run the programs as given in step 4, 6 and 8.
OR
type:
gcc server.c -o server -lpthread

4. Run server_tcp.c (./server_tcp 8888)

5. Open other terminal tab and go to destination folder.
OR
type:
gcc client_tcp.c -o client_tcp 

6. Run client_tcp.c with a command "list" (./client_tcp 127.0.0.1 8888 list)

7. Open other terminal tab and go to destination folder.
OR
type:
gcc client_udp.c -o client_udp 

8. Run client_udp.c with a command "order" (./client_tcp 127.0.0.1 8888 order 1000 20)

9. You can also add create multiple clients to test for concurrency.
